# Food Truck Project


## Description
- This project was completed after the second week of Skill Distillery's Full Stack Software Development with Java Bootcamp.
- FoodTruckApp prompts a user to input information for up 5 food trucks to include, the food truck's name, type of food, and rating. The user will then be given options to display 	all food truck information, display the highest rated food truck information, see the average of ratings, or quit the program.

- The purpose of this program was to grasp a greater understanding of creating class objects, array of objects, static vs non-static methods and fields, invoking objects to use methods and most importantly data encapsulation.

- This program was created for educational purposes only and does not have any real world application.


## Lessons Learned
- I started to think I wanted to create separate FoodTruck objects after accepting inputs and place them inside an array afterwards. That made zero sense. But I had to go through the motions first to realize that.

- Some in my Cohort started the project with accepting inputs while I started with a hardcoded FoodTruck[] and worked and tested all my method before working on the input part. Just goes to show you can start a project from just about anywhere.


- No argument class constructors are useful if you do not want to assign class fields at instantiation

- Instantiation of an object in its' own class to use its' own methods was a bit confusing but I understand static and non-static field don't mesh. You can use non static methods in a static method if you instantiate that class as an invoking object to invoke/call your methods which used to be non-static but since they are in a static main, you can now use them. 

- The toString method can do whatever you want it though that doesn't mean you should do anything outside of things related to returning the string format you 
want

-Data encapsulation was the whole point of only have one static field with the use of setters and getters to return data you need.

- I'm still grasping on to the concepts here.
